				Hi there 👋 I'm Kristen. I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristen-manning-83b266104">software developer and former startup exec</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a consultant, I specialize in helping small businesses and early-stage startups to automate their operations, leverage powerful software products and low-code tools, and build prototypes of new products. <b>My work frees up business owners and startup founders to focus on the big picture.</b> Think: "CTO" or "Founding Engineer" on an as-needed basis. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I split my time between Midcoast Maine and New York City. Most of my work is done remotely, though I'm happy to meet in-person in Maine or NY. On-site engagements in other cities may be available upon request. 
			</p>

			What is kairoi? 
		</p>
		<p>
			I learned about the concept of kairos (plural: kairoi), meaning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos">critical or opportune moment for action</a>, while reading <a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/writing.html">Jenny Odell's</a> book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672377/saving-time-by-jenny-odell/">Saving Time</a>. It stuck with me and came to mind again when reflecting on what sort of consulting business I wanted to build. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My goal here is not to grow a huge team of developers or convince tons of folks to pay for my services. Rather, my intention is to <b>build relationships with startups, small businesses, and individuals, and collaborate during critical moments in their growth journeys</b> - moments that present a unique opportunity for my skillset to advance their goals. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If the moment is not right for me to have an outsized impact on your business, then I will do my best to help you find the person who can. Let's get to know each other!
